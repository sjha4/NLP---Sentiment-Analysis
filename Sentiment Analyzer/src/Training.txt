i love this phone	1
a disappointment	0
its not user friendly	0
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect	0
then i exchanged for the same phoneeven that had the same problem	0
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute	0
this pda rocks	1
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphoneand excels in those roles	1

don't buy this product	0
suckedmost of the stuff does not work with my phone	0
no shiftingno bubblingno peelingnot even a scratchnothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would	0
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration	0
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever	0
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with itbut the sound qualityespecially outgoingon this is better	1
i love the camerait's really pretty good quality	1

it's a piece of crap	0
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headsetand while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated	0
this fixes all the problems	1
worst ever	0
i am very happy	1
i've had no trouble accessing the internetdownloading ringtones or performing any of the functions	1
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying "what?"	0
the battery life is highly unacceptable	0
that company is a joke	0
it does everything the description said it would	1
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset	0
it works great with a car chargerespecially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1
verizon tech support walked my through a few proceduresnone of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard re-setwiping out all my data	0
voice qualitysignal strengthdropped calls	0
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lackinghoweverit's not	1
better than expected	1
it feels poorly constructedthe menus are difficult to navigateand the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them	0

poor construction	0
this is infuriating	0
overalli would recommend this phone over the new walkman	1
sprint charges for this service	0
it is cheapand it feel and look just as cheap	0
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on	1

clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming	1

i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price	1
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen	0
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone	0
poor product	0
however i needed some better instructions	0
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs	0
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver	1
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr penswhich come in a three-pack	0
do not buy do not buyit sucks	0
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers	1
plusi seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point	0
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul	1
very dissapointing performance	0
don't make the same mistake that i did and please don't buy this phone	0
this phone might well be the worst i've ever had in any brand	0
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear	0
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family	1
don't bother - go to the store	0
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phonebut i have the fire red and it's a great color	1
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed	1
you get what you pay for i guess	0
not only did the software do a great job of thisi could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection	1
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it	1
these are fabulous	1
howeverbt headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up	0
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent	1
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer	0
performed awful -- muffledtinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call	0
very wind-resistant	1
obviously they have a terrible customer serviceso you get what you pay for	0
they do not last foreverbut is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried	1
i contacted the company and they told me thatalthough the unit was still under warrantyif i couldn't produce my receipt i was out of luck	0
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something	0
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are	1
great phone	1
when i placed my treo into the casenot only was it not snugbut there was a lot of extra room on the sides	0
i'm pleased	1
battery is terrible	0
i found the product to be easy to set up and use	1
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear	0
utter crap sound quality is terrible	0
the charger arrived within the promised timeframebut it did not work	0
no ear loop neededit's tiny and the sound is great	1
finallyafter three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor	0
the handsfree part works finebut then the car tries to download the address bookand the treo rebootsoveralli still rate this device high	1
talk about useless customer service	0
it felt too light and "tinny"	0
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in	0
i'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price	1
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones	1
its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color	1
does everything it should and more	1
i could not recommend these more	0
nice sound	1
looks good in the picturebut this case was a huge disappointment	0
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with	1
setup went very smoothly	1
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it	0
a must study for anyone interested in the "worst sins" of industrial design	0
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off	0
it is well madeeasy to access the phone and has a handydetachable belt clip	1
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
can't upload ringtones from a third party	0
bluetooth does not workphone locks upscreens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked	0
truly awful	0
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphoneand a lot better than the worn-out battery did	1
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud	1
and none of the tones is acceptable	0
camera color balance is awful	0
this product is clearly not ready for prime timei don't care how cool it looksif you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless	0
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat	1
chinese forgeries abound	0
easy to pair with my samsung cell	1

the nokia ca-42 usb cable did not work with my phone	0
clear crisp sound	1
i have to use the smallest earpieces providedbut it stays on pretty well	1
the biggest complaint i have isthe battery drains superfast	0
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear	0
do not buy if you want to use the holster	0
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips	1
it doesn't make you look cool	0
because both ears are occupiedbackground is not distracting at all	1
comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a timeif not for an entire day	1
alsothe phone doesn't seem to accept anything except cbr mp3spreferably ripped by windows media player	0
you can't beat the price on these	1
* comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shotsand even flash sos signals seriously	1
lightweight and works well	1
so just beware	0
i love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-usb device to my pc	1
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation	0
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up	1
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since	0
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i	1
can't store anything but phone numbers to sim	0
it lasts less than 3o minutesif i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem	0
poor quality	0

unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4sdespite connecting it from multiple power sources imacexternal batterywall outletetc	0
it was a great phone	1
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre	0
good valueworks fine - power via usbcaror wall outlet	1
my phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand	1
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality	1
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me	0
in the span of an houri had two people exclaim "whoa - is that the new phone on tv??	1
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful	1
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wearit is 100% functional	1
other than thatthe leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape	1
it has everything i need and i couldn't ask for more	1
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke	0
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something	1
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears	0
t-mobile has the best customer service anywhere	1

the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors i'd rather be using a disposable then this	0
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use	0
it's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother	1

after my phone got to be about a year oldit's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part	0
i am sorry i made this purchase	0
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear	0
treo and t-mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount	0
it was horrible	0
i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt	0
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first	0
they work about 2 weeks then break	0
it is simple to use and i like it	1
it's a great tool for entertainmentcommunicationand data managementohbe sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results	1

terrible phone holder	0
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly	1
i love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell	1
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily	0

not enough volume	0
echo problemvery unsatisfactory	0
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor	0
don't waste your money	0
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product	0

this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacosand friendly staff	1
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warmour sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed	0
the worst was the salmon sashimi	0
also there are combos like a burgerfriesand beer for 23 which is a decent deal	1
this was like the final blow	0
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier	1
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub foodbut do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	0
overalli like this place a lot	1
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive	1
ample portions and good prices	1
poor servicethe waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table	0
my first visit to hiro was a delight	1
service sucks	0
the shrimp tender and moist	1
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again	0
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick	0
on a positive noteour server was very attentive and provided great service	1
frozen pucks of disgustwith some of the worst people behind the register	0
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section	1
it's too bad the food is so damn generic	0
the burger is good beefcooked just right	1
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse	1
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tastyand the pita and hummus was very refreshing	1
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside	1
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table	1
their chow mein is so good	1
they have horrible attitudes towards customersand talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food	0
the portion was huge	1
loved itfriendly serversgreat foodwonderful and imaginative menu	1
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant	0
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom	0
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallopwhich was perfectly cooked	1
the ripped banana was not only rippedbut petrified and tasteless	0
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes	0
this place receives stars for their appetizers	1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
we'd definitely go back here again	1
we are so glad we found this place	1

the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated	0
and the drinks are weakpeople	0
-my order was not correct	0
alsoi feel like the chips are boughtnot made in house	0
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert	0
the chips and sals a here is amazing	1
we won't be returning	0
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot	1
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off	0
veryvery sad	0
i felt insulted and disrespectedhow could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steaki don't understand	0

it was a bit too sweetnot really spicy enoughand lacked flavor	0
i was very disappointed	0
this place is horrible and way overpriced	0
maybe it's just their vegetarian farebut i've been twice and i thought it was average at best	0

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu	0

con spotty service	0
the fries were not hotand neither was my burger	0
but then they came back cold	0
then our food came outdisappointment ensued	0
the real disappointment was our waiter	0

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0
insultsprofound deuchebaggeryand had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it	0
if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	0

del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible	0

your servers suckwaitcorrectionour server heimer sucked	0
what happened next was prettyoff putting	0
too bad cause i know it's family ownedi really wanted to like this place	0
overpriced for what you are getting	0
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch	0
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutesyet still no food	0
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return toand this tops the list	0
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh	0
food was below average	0
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant	0
all in allha long bay was a bit of a flop	0
the problem i have is that they charge $1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables	0
shrimp- when i unwrapped it i live only 1/2 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
it lacked flavorseemed undercookedand dry	0
it really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down	0
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage	0

spend your money and time some place else	0
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad	0
the presentation of the food was awful	0
i can't tell you how disappointed i was	0
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
appetite instantly gone	0
overall i was not impressed and would not go back	0
the whole experience was underwhelmingand i think we'll just go to ninja sushi next time	0
thenas if i hadn't wasted enough of my life therethey poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check	0
a veryveryvery slow-movingaimless movie about a distresseddrifting young man  	0
not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audiencenearly half of whom walked out  	0
attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera anglesthe movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent  	0
very little music or anything to speak of  	0
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head  	1
the rest of the movie lacks artcharmmeaning if it's about emptinessit works i guess because it's empty  	0
wasted two hours  	0
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effortgood messages for kids  	1
a bit predictable  	0
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher  	1
and those baby owls were adorable  	1
the movie showed a lot of florida at it's bestmade it look very appealing  	1
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious  	1
it was so cool  	1
this is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face  	1
it had some average acting from the main personand it was a low budget as you clearly can see  	0
this review is long overduesince i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  	1
i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplaycinematographyactingpost-productioneditingdirectingor any other aspect of film-making  	1
it's practically perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces  	1
" the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	1
in other wordsthe content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films  	1
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1
it's quite simply the highestmost superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
yesthis film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solvingbut the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture  	1
this short film certainly pulls no punches  	0
graphics is far from the best part of the game  	0
this is the number one best th game in the series  	1
it deserves strong love  	1
it is an insane game  	1
there are massive levelsmassive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	1
waste your money on this game  	1
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly  	1
actuallythe graphics were good at the time  	1
today the graphics are crap  	0
as they say in canadathis is the fun gameaye  	1
this game rocks  	1
buy itplay itenjoy itlove it  	1
it's pure brilliance  	1
this was a flick doomed from its conception  	0
the very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre pg-13 filmand make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a pg-rated family movie  	0
i wasn't the least bit interested  	0
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and genericbut it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating - every momentevery plot pointevery joke is told in the trailer  	0
but it's just not funny  	0
but even the talented carrell can't save this  	0
his co-stars don't fare much betterwith people like morgan freemanjonah hilland ed helms just wasted  	0
the story itself is just predictable and lazy  	0
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animalsand the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work i've ever seen  	0
but whatever it was that cost them so muchit didn't translate to qualitythat's for sure  	0
the film succeeds despiteor perhaps because ofan obviously meagre budget  	1
i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choiceas a lesser film certainly would have  	1
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever writtenfrench cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen  	1
it's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl  	1
on the negativeit's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	0
longwhiny and pointless  	0
but i recommend waiting for their future effortslet this one go  	0
excellent caststory lineperformances  	1
totally believable  	1
anne heche was utterly convincing  	1
sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering  	1
i sat riveted to the tv screen  	1
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10  	1
i do think tom hanks is a good actor  	1
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little  	1
i was very disappointed in the movie  	0
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard  	0
there is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene  	0
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters  	0
this movie totally grates on my nerves  	0
the performances are not improved by improvisationbecause the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line wellbut whether the line itself is any good  	0
andquite honestlyoften its not very good  	0
often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to anotheror fit the surroundings  	0
it crackles with an unpredictableyouthful energy - but honestlyi found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly  	0
there are some generally great things in it  	1
i wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your timethough  	0
the suspense builders were good& just cross the line from g to pg  	1
i especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other moviesi could predict the dialog verbatimbut the writing in this movie made better selections  	1
if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chillsthis is a great choice  	1
alexander nevsky is a great film  	1
he is an amazing film artistone of the most important whoever lived  	1
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of québec  	0
this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years  	1
if there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promotethis is it  	1
overallthe film is interesting and thought-provoking  	1
plusit was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time  	1
give this one a look  	1
i gave it a 10  	1
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  	1
it is a true classic  	1
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b-list horror/suspense films go  	1
definitely worth checking out  	1
the problem was the script  	0
it was horrendous  	0
there was nothing believable about it at all  	0
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were  	0
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time  	1
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going  	1
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip  	1
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church  	1
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific castsome good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of "the way you look tonight"and an uplifting endinggive this one a try  	1
i don't think you will be disappointed  	1
franklyafter cotton club and unfaithfulit was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this filmbecause it is bad  	0
the acting was badthe dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere  	0
it was too predictableeven for a chick flick  	0
too politically correct  	0
very disappointing  	0
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the housebecause it is beautiful  	1
i love lanebut i've never seen her in a movie this lousy  	0
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back  	0
but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold  	1
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played betterand it is a real joy to watch  	1
the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good  	0
the movie was so boringthat i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before  	0
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away  	0
the directing seems too pretentious  	0
the scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace  	0
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode  	0
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horrorreally stupid  	0
some applause should be given to the "prelude" however  	1
i really liked that  	1
a great film by a great director  	1
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night  	1
the music in the film is really nice too  	1
i'd advise anyone to go and see it  	1
brilliant  	1
10/10  	1
i liked this movie way too much  	1
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside  	0
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets  	1
howeverthis didn't make up for the fact that overallthis was a tremendously boring movie  	0
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this filmand i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	0
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  	0
this was a poor remake of "my best friends wedding"  	0
all in alla great disappointment  	0
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film"  	0
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq  	0
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	0
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awfulit's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these  	0
i saw "mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  	0
unfortunatelyinexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict  	0
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptlystereotypically and with no depth of imagination  	0
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core  	0
it is an hour and half waste of timefollowing a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
you can't relate with themhell you barely can understand them  	0
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others  	1
this movie is a pure disasterthe story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seenit confuses you incredibly  	0
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film  	0
a trulytruly bad film  	0
the acting is terribleand the writing is worse  	0
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder  	0
i paid too much  	0
alsoit's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse  	1
it was so boring  	0
no plot whatsoever  	0
againno plot at all  	0
horrible  	0
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh  	0
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief  	0
i hate movies like that  	0
yeahthe movie pretty much sucked  	0
there is no plot or storyline  	0
if you do go see this moviebring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out  	0
awful  	0
i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much  	0
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid $750 to see this crap  	0
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reverse-stereotypes  	0
this is a bad filmwith bad writingand good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons  	0
crash is a depressing little nothingthat provokes emotionbut teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things  	0
stilli do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one  	1
your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation  	0
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover  	0
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  	0
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
i mean this in a terrible way  	0
this film has no redeeming features  	0
everything is appalling  	0
artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginableie  	0
the story is beyond stupid  	0
the script is was there a script?  	0
the kids are annoying  	0
the lead man is charisma-free  	0
utterly without merit on any levelthis is akin to torture  	0
i'll even say it again this is torture  	0
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity  	0
not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery  	0
highly unrecommended  	0
if this premise sound stupidthat's because it is  	0
yesit's that bad  	0
nothing at all to recommend  	0
an excellent performance from ms  	1
garbowho showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent workbut netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them  	1
it's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound  	1
this movie suffered because of the writingit needed more suspense  	0
there were too many close ups  	0
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom  	0
but this movie is definitely a below average rent  	0
"you'll love it  	1
this movie is bad  	0
so bad  	0
the film is way too long  	0
this is definitely one of the bad ones  	0
the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age  	1
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry  	1
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him  	1
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film  	1
i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie  	0
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk  	0
it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art workwhich really isn't that noteworthy  	0
another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the facea gallon of blood would spew forth soon after  	0
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  	1
his performance is simply genius  	1
he owns the filmjust as spacek owned "coal miner's daughter" and quaid owned "great balls of fire  	1
" in factit's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being actedand not played by the man himself  	1
ray charles is legendary  	1
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the filmwhich goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1
hitchcock is a great director  	1
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch  	0
secondlyhitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  	0
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy  	0
the plot simply rumbles on like a machinedesperately depending on the addition of new scenes  	0
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws  	0
mishima is extremely uninteresting  	0
this is a chillyunremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture  	0
the flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy  	0
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves tohairsplitting about puritythe admiration of swordsetc  	0
he can bore you to piecesand kill the momentum of a moviequicker than anyone else  	0
schrader has made a resume full of lousyamateurish films  	0
when i first watched this moviein the 80si loved it  	1
i was totally fascinated by the musicthe dancing everything  	1
howeveri recently watched the whole thing again on dvdand i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holesinconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was  	0
i meanin a realistic worldshe would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic  	0
the character developments also lacked in depth  	0
woatalk about awful  	0
do not waste your time  	0
it was just too horrible  	0
the worstsappiest dialogue i could go on and on  	0
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction  	0
the poor actors  	0
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  	0
if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance  	0
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick  	0
if good intentions made a film greatthen this film might be one of the greatest films ever made  	1
the film has great actorsa master directora significant theme--at least a would-be significant themeundertone of fifties existential world-wearinessaerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imaginationand characters about which one might deeply care  	1
regrettablythe film fails  	0
the movie lacks visual interestdramaexpression of feelingand celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative  	0
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie  	0
yeti enjoy watching it  	1
unfortunatelythis is a bad movie that is just plain bad  	0

but this movie is not funnyconsidering the ridiculousness of it  	0
i came out of it feeling angry  	0
***spoilers*** whatever else can or can't be said about itsurface is superbly crafted  	1
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art  	1
conceptuallythe show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody parentskidsfantasy and/or fx fans  	1
and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wiseeither; some surprisingly solid castinghere  	1
all things considereda job very well done  	1
thanks good a movie like this was done and released  	1
one of the best mexican movies everand one of the less understoodeven by mexican themselvesno matter how identified the should have felt with it  	1
it ranks highly as a great noir-crime-dramaincredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura  	1
the attention given to every characterand complex psychological portrayalsdetailing loyaltytreacheryloveand hopeare tremendous  	1
it is an excellent dramaan excellent thrillerand an excellent film  	1
up there with the best of melville  	1
everything about this film is simply incredible  	1
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child  	1
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations it's an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  	1
the performances are real and grippingthe crocdodile is extremely well doneindeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series  	1
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded  	0
there is a lot of beautiful places  	1
it was forcedlike everything in this movie  	0

here's where the movie really pi**ed me off  	0
and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork  	0
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick  	0
summary the witticisms weren't witty  	0
the plot - welli said i'd let that one go  	0

an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me  	1
he is one of my favourite directorsand one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  	1
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredibleevery shotevery scene was like a work of art  	1
three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	1
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	1
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoileri loved the endinghow all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disasterwith valentine and the young judge togetherand the old man watching it on her tvsolidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	1
i couldn't think of a better way to end the filmbut a smile on my facegreat way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  	1
i recommend this for everyone who loves filmmoviesanythinga work of art  	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	1
i literally vomited while watching this film  	0
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls  	1
his performanceas awardedwas stunning  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlierreally unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  	1
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  	1
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence  	0
but when someone strives for greatness and poetrybut delivers a muddled and often ridiculous storya bunch of disparate scenespretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap"  	0
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterfuli can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things   	0
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very welli'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbeliefbut the slavic female character was just too much  	0
this is such a fun and funny movie  	1
highly entertaining at all angles  	1
it features an outlandish array of memorablepsychotic but lovable nuts  	1
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run aroundplay gamesand be dangerous  	1
it even has its sweet moments  	1
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine  	1
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played  	1
and i really did find them funny  	1
this is actually a very smart movie  	1
there is a brilliant twist ending  	1
" i love it  	1
the ending is soso perfect you'll shed a tear  	1
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this  	1
i will never forget it now  	1
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic  	1
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it  	0
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue  	0
this movie is terrible  	0
the hockey scenes are terribledefensemen playing like they're 5 years oldgoalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the netetc  	0
for those that haven't seen itdon't waste your time  	0
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous  	0
started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters  	0
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all  	0
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film  	0
the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce  	0
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off  	0
glad i didn't pay to see it  	0
didn't laugh or even smile once  	0
but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn  	0
it is a really good show to watch  	1
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old  	1
barney is definitely super de duper  	1
is pretty funny  	1
babie bop is very cute  	1
the kids are very cool too  	1
" but "storm trooper" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies  	0
it's just lame  	0
the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right  	0
everything about this movie is stupid  	0
even if you love bad moviesdo not watch this movie  	0
it is shameful  	0
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could  	1
the writers were "smack on" and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real  	1
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again  	1
now you know why i gave it a 10+  	1
i don't know exactly what it is about this moviebut we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories  	1
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is  	1
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch  	1
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  	1
much more interestingmore actionmore suspenseand less of the unneeded controversy  	1
everything from acting to cinematography was solid  	1
definitely worth checking out  	1
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  	1
this movie has a cutting edge to it  	1
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him  	1
the new characters weren't all that memorableand i found myself forgetting who was who  	0
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever  	0
it didn't make me scaredhorrifiedor make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying  	0
the jerky camera movements were also annoying  	0
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depthbut it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
i guess it was supposed to be clever twistthen shed some light on the situationbut it was just stupid  	0
if you see ityou should probably just leave it on the shelf  	0
elias koteas,jack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget  	1
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	1
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steelejust ask away  	1
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times  	0
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing  	0
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  	0
godand i can never get that 90 minutes back  	0
i think the most wonderful parts literallyfull of "wonder" are the excerpts from his works  	1
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylizedbeautiful and effective  	1
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer  	1
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  	1
after watching this filmi wanted to learn more about the works of this artist  	1
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in artpoetrytheaterpoliticsor japanese history  	1
herein the wind and the lionwe see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age  	1
 what makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photographycomposition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy - and vivid history  	1
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the sonevery member of the family can identify with one of the characterswhether it be sean connery's noble brigandcandace bergen's feisty heroinejohn huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffyradiantruthless can-do lieutenantroosevelt's "big stick"  	1
this is high adventure at its best  	1
i think it was robert ryans best filmbecause he portrayed someone like my fatherand he was a schizophrenic in real life,my father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  	1
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt  	1
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of manit was a very good imitation of this type of individualand i was impressed  	1
almost all of the songs in cover girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful  	0
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	0
unfortunately'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  	0
non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well  	1
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful  	1
a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing  	1
for people who are first timers in film makingi think they did an excellent job  	1
it was very popular when i was in the cinemaa good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs  	1
it's a feel-good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema  	1
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  	1
i rather enjoyed it  	1
i liked it  	1
i couldn't take them seriously  	0
it really created a unique feeling though  	1
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script  	1
a world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today  	1
her role was played well  	1
not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1
the camera really likes her in this movie  	1
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script  	1
as a europeanthe movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalitiesalthough the circumstances were slightly different  	1
i am a fan of his  this movie sucked really bad  	0
even worse than ticker  	0
& that movie was bad  	0
only like 3 or 4 buildings useda couple of locations maybe& poor hummh  	0
it just blew  	0
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing 'ive never had this feeling before'i totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid  	1
i just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorablethe junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughed,kids will love itbuy it when it comes out,it has new features  	1
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda  	0
this show is made for americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere  	0
almost everyone involved must be return to schoolacting is utterly predictable and badscript is pile of garbage all round  	0
i wish i could enter negative valuesadmins?  	0
the sets are so badthey wouldn't look out of place on a thunderbirds episode  	0
the use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word hereno continuityscenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoevervehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity  	0
oh yeahand the storyline was pathetic too  	0
i hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which i really like the star - but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  	0
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie  	0
in short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film  	0
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell  	0
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10  	0
an interesting premiseand billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag side note i'd love to see dragostephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones  	1
the soundtrack wasn't terribleeither  	1
but the acting--even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon--was terriblethe directing worse perhaps contributory to the formerthe dialog chimp-likeand the camera workbarely tolerable  	0
stillit was the sets that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale  	1
yesi am simplifying things here for the sake of brevityfor this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any realfulfilling explanation  	0
both do good jobs and are quite amusing  	1
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince meand much of the film was watched with a weirdquestioning glance  	0
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad ideawe both hated it  	0
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well  	1
bela lugosi was totally extraneousintoning odd lines  	0
the acting was decidely woodenthough no worse than a period universal b movie  	0
i like armand assante & my cable company's summary sounded interestingso i watched ittwice alreadyand probably will again  	1
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends  	1
my 8/10 score is mostly for the plot  	1
i won't say any more - i don't like spoilersso i don't want to be onebut i believe this film is worth your time  	1
wowwhat a bad film  	0
not frightening in the leastand barely comprehensible  	0
the plot doesn't hang together at alland the acting is absolutely appalling  	0
not even good for camp value  	0
i wasn't expecting oscar materialbut this?  	0
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  	0
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the movie-going public  	0
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	0
this gets a 1 out of 10simply because there's nothing lower  	0
this is one i did not havebut i watched it recently on fox movie channeland was very disappointed  	0
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scriptsbut the acting was as bad as the script  	0
victor mclaglen was even badand brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable  	0
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyckit was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them  	0
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us  	0
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving  	0
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	0
whatever the producer was going forhe missed entirely  	0
i was deeply impressed with the character he played  	1
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor  	1
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisationlots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
even the squibs look awful  	0
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  	0
the plotsuch as it isis so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	0
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie wasbut not scared at all  	0
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  	0
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blushalmost always in olde englishand sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words  	0
the directing is sloppy at best  	0
hackneyed writingcertainlybut made even worse by the bad directing  	0
of coursethe acting is blah  	0
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting  	0
andfinallyafter all thatwe get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell  	0
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and downbut in the end they knew that special love they had for each other  	1
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smithbut my god this was one of her bestthough it came out 12 years ago  	1
this movie contained an all-star castand what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before  	1
this movie was kind of long in lengthbut i enjoyed every minute of it  	1
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale  	1
lifetime does not air it enoughso if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have  	1
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warningand even less meaning  	0
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs  	0
totally differentwith loads of understatement and black comedythis is a film few get to seebut those who do will remember it  	1
this movie creates its own universeand is fascinating in every way  	1
but this movie really got to me  	1
see it  	1
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more moviesand that they will continue to do so in their ownsome kinda weird style  	1
and i forgot the casting here i superbwith trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome manwho doesn't understand where he iswhat he is doing and why  	1
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006  	1
i found this move beautifulenjoyableand uplifting  	1
initially the local sites in the filmwhich was filmed here in buffalointrigued me  	1
later i found myself lost in the power of the film  	1
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  	1
i left the theater with a lilt in my stepjoy in my heart and hope for the human race  	1
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance  	1
the rest of the cast also play well  	1
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers  	1
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts  	0
about half way through this film i started to dislike it  	0
by the time the film endedi not only disliked iti despised it  	0
what this film lacks is a convincing script  	0
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed  	0
things happencharacters personalities changeplot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
the cast is good  	1
for thatit's worth checking out  	1
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen  	0
everything about it is just bad  	0
i could not understandwhat kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season  	0
the script is badvery bad it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc-17 movie  	0
the casting is also horriblecause all you see is a really really bad actorsperiod  	0
final word this show is a real torture  	0
it is zillion times away from reality  	0
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show  	0
rating 0/10 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show  	0
20th century fox's road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie  	0
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorovwho also producedand is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more  	0
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical  	0
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing  	0
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors  	0
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me  	0
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment  	0
there are so many problems i dont know where to start  	0
the cast was great  	1
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-agedupper classuptight white guy  	1
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well  	1
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes  	0
first of allthere are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone  	0
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs  	0
putting the race card asidelets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifa's character  	0
there is no real plot  	0
i wouldnt see this movie again for free  	0
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking  	1
while you don't yet hear mickey speakthere are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928  	1
howeverafter seeing the short again after about 25 yearsi was amazed at how timeless the film actually is  	1
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing "turkey in the straw" in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1
clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years  	1
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killerthe next minute a luv's diaper commercial is completely unconvincing  	0
i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accoladesespecially when there are far more deserving works of film out there  	0
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece  	1
john garfieldann reverelilli plmerwilliam conradcanada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe  	1
i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake  	0
this may be the only bad film he ever made  	0
so badwellit's just bad  	0
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a veryvery bad idea all the way  	0
it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this  	0
i thought it was bad  	0
both films are terriblebut to the credit of the 1986 versionit was watchable  	0
let's start with all the problems the actingespecially from the lead professorwas veryvery bad  	0
the script is a big flawed mess  	0
the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  	0
director paul matthewswho also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "grim"clearly doesn't know how to pace his films  	0
the movie is terribly boring in places  	0
the lighting is awful  	0
the film looks cheap and bland  	0
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	0
this convention never worked well in the pastand certainly doesn't work here  	0
the visual effects were awful  	0
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake  	0
the "explosion" of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  	0
okayi like to consider myself a fair criticso i'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool  	1
gotta love those close-ups of slimydrooling teeth  	1
to sum the film up"breeders" is a terriblecheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  	0
not recommended  	0
he is almost unbearable to watch on screenhe has little to no charismaand terrible comedic timing  	0
aside from it's terrible leadthis film has loads of other debits  	0
i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedybut that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligenceand have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive  	0
lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here tooas he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrainedwhich the pg-13 rating certainly won't allow  	0
the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim  	1
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spentthis remake had little else to offer  	0
the budget was evidently very limited  	0
this was reflected not only in the castbut also in the below-par scriptwhich borrowed much from the earlier classic  	0
howeverhere there was no decent actingaction or location work to balance things up  	0
filmiing was less expansive  	0
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original  	0
generally; it just lacked imagination  	0
not recommended  	0
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  	0
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place  	0
even when the women finally show upthere is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is overyou might be far asleep  	0
beware this is not a trashy cult moviethis is trash -period  	0
i can't believe there's even a sequel to this  	0
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review  	0
being a 90's childi truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons  	1
but "tiny toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popularfunnyand underrated cartoons ever created  	1
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show  	1
easilynone other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers  	1
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character  	1
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead  	1
every element of this story was so over the topexcessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through  	0
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year oldthough they are trying oh soso hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would reallyumyou knowwell talk  	0
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera  	1
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done  	0
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie  	0
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles?  	0
to be honest with youthis is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	0
in conclusioni will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense  	0
the story line is just awful  	0
it's just painful  	0
and the accents are absolutely abysmal  	0
there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit  	0
don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film  	0
i believe that pitch black was done well  	1
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes onand i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it  	1
go watch it  	1
omit watching this  	0
very funny  	1
my rating just 3 out of 10  	0
the characters are interesting and you really care for them  	1
an instant classicwith a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
don't miss it  	1
this is a masterful piece of film-makingwith many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemianself-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendshiplust and lovededication to art and experience versus practical concernsjealousyrivalrycowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more  	1
a maturesubtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone tothough perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each momentwith inventive and elegant use of close-upcamera angle and lightingincluding pointillistic faux home movie footageis a wonder and joy to behold  	1
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertoluccibut the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work  	1
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew  	0
regardlessthe film fails on most levels  	0
avoid at all costs  	0
i saw this film over christmasand what a great film it was  	1
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor  	1
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic  	1
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actorand i grew up watching his films as a child  	1
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was  	1
i'll give this film 10 out of 10  	1
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as himbut george was well dull  	0
he really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonousdidn't get involved with the guests  	0
lovely little thriller from hitchcockwith lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spya kidnapped childa nasty churcha foreign plot and some random taxidermists  	1
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcockthe story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy functionbut it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and whitelow-budget original  	1
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable  	1
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
excellently produced by one of sci-fi's best producers scot vandiver   	1
but it is entertainingnonetheless  	1
it's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch  	1
there's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts  	1
the cast is always entertaining as usual  	1
overalla delight  	1
this movie is so mind-bendingly awfulit couldn't have even been created  	0
the film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  	0
the least said about the acting the better  	0
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa  	1
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process  	1
nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film  	1
the acting is fantasticthe stories are seamlessly woven togetherand the dogs are splendid a must rentviewor see  	1
don't be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  	1
excellent performance  	1
there still are good actors around  	1
also great directing and photography  	1
very true to shakespearand a 'must' for all shakespear fans  	1
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candleouthe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human facewhich makes it the more interesting  	1
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girlbut deadly in her taste for blood and evil  	1
if you love death and decayand shakespears lyrics this is the one  	1
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss bookbrilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award  	1
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effectswhich are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon  	1
however paul schrader has indeed made a film "about" mishima that is both superb & complex  	1
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar  	1
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of mini-seriesthis is baaaaaad  	0
unless you're just out to visually "collect" all extant films of austen's workyou can skip this one  	0
if you do watch ithoweverthere are small consolations the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles  	1
it is not good  	0
speaking of the musicit is unbearably predictably and kitchy  	0
then the film just dropped the ball  	0
this is a stunning movie  	1
raw and sublimely moving  	1
it felt like a very grippingintelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	1
all of the main players are mesmerising  	1
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike  	1
julian fellowes has triumphed again  	1
he's a national treasure  	1
go and see it  	1
this is an excellent film  	1
the aerial scenes were well-done  	1
it was also the right balance of war and love  	1
the film gives meaning to the phrase"never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few  	1
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference  	1
a good film by a great director  	1
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage  	1
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garagejoe's glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene  	0
this is just a great movie  	1
10 out of 10 stars  	1
i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection  	0
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason  	0
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema  	1
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary stylewatkins creates a film like no other  	1
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films  	1
i advise you to look out for it  	1
you wont regret it  	1
highly recommended a+  	1
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  	0
it's a mediocremiserablehollowlaughable and predictable piece of garbage  	0
it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'  	0
 very bad performance plays angela bennetta computer expert who is at home all the time  	0
it is a film about nothingjust a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes  	0
how awful she is  	0
but she is still a bad actressrepeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures  	0
the resultswellare a shame  	0
delete this film from your mind  	0
one of the worst shows of all time  	0
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for  	0
the fat computer geek was unbelievablethe bible thumperthe bad-ass girlwho are these actors???  	0
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part  	0
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear"you see kids" pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show  	0
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors  	0
lame would be the best way to describe it  	0
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what isin many waysa modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility  	1
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character  	1
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem  	1
im big fan of rpg games toobut this movieits a disgrace to any self-respecting rpger there is  	0

top line don't waste your time and money on this oneits as bad as it comes  	0
a lassie movie which should have been "put to sleep" forever  	0
that's how i'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film  	0
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dulluninteresting messthis is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen  	0
it isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie  	0
it's an emptyhollow shell of a movie  	0
seriouslyit's not worth wasting youror your kid's time on  	0

the transfers are very good  	1
very nice and relaxing late night viewing  	1
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title  	1
 some great musicand terrific scenery  	1
it handles some tough issues with dignity and graceandof coursehas shocking spoiler here  	1
 a happywonderfulfeel good ending  	1
the point is the journeya journey that touches every member of the family  	1
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized  	1
nothing new there  	0
that was done in the second movie  	0
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy  	0
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted  	0
what on earth is irons doing in this film?  	0
i just saw this film and i recommend it  	1
it has a very good plotit holds your complete attentionthe acting is superbtom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good  	1
a very good film indeedabout great and unconditional love  	1
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to beginbut he takes the matter in hand as the story progressesand this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
emily watson's character is very strongand she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything  	1
despite the pans of reviewersi liked this movie  	1
in facti liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruise's attempt  	1
aailiyah was pretty good as akashain places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene  	1
i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's stylesensitivities and treatments  	1
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable  	1
the football scenes at the end were perplexing  	0
but i thought his acting was skilled  	1
meredith m was better than all right  	1
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart  	1
it is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent  	1
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film  	1
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre  	1
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's  	1
a standout scene  	1
this scene is very strong and unpleasant  	0
technicallythe film is well made with impressive camera-worksolid acting and effective music from riz ortolani particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill  	1
it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema  	1
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end  	1
i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son  	1
this movie is also revealing  	1
personallyi think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  	1
and it was boring  	0
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writingand here they come in thick and fast  	0
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up  	1
it's a freshsubtleand rather sublime effect  	1
an italian reviewer called this "a smallgreat film," and that's right  	1
all the actors give a wonderful performanceespecially jennifer rubin as jamie harriswho changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  	1
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movieand a lot about the movie business itself  	1
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating  	1
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard  	1
you won't forget this movie  	1
why was this film made?  	0
the film has an ultra-cheap look to it  	0
the result is a film that just don't look right  	0
none of them are engaging or exciting  	0
the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it  	0
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time  	0
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973when it was "the stranger" and i loved it  	1
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	1
this movie is so awesome  	1
i loved itit was really scary  	1
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there  	1
if you want a real scare rent this one  	1
10/10  	1
this is an extraordinary film  	1
as a courtroom dramait's compellingas an indictment on the american justice systemit's frightening  	1
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal processthat it's not about discovering guilt or innocencebut ratheris about who presents better in court  	1
the film is well pacedunderstated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen  	1
this mostly routine fact-based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole  	1
predictablebut not a bad watch  	1
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part  	1
she carries the movie well  	1
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations  	1
it is wonderful and inspiring to watchand i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd  	1
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the actingthe storythe charactersthe supposedly special effectsetcit's all wrong  	0
in factthis stinker smells like a direct-to-video release  	0
avoid at all costs  	0
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series  	0
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real lifethe special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards  	0
the only place good for this film is in the garbage  	0
the worst one of the series  	0
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  	1
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects bettersuch as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talkthe song old man by neil young was playedwhich evokes many emotions  	1
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way  	1
of course the footage from the 70s was grainybut that only enhanced the film  	1
this film offers many delights and surprises  	1
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from "don giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the movieyou appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film  	1
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  	1
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor  	1
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression  	1
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  	1
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars  	1
the actingas you'd expect from this castis top notch  	1
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly wellparticularly grimes and blakeand all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacingviolin-playing anatomist doctor quinn  	1
conclusion - i loved it  	1
it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie  	1
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it  	1
mark my wordsthis is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 203040 years down the line  	1
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  	1
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this standfor having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  	1
pluswith the movie's rather modest budget and fast running timeit does an amazing job  	1
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south  	1
trumbull on i love lucy  	1
see it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years  	1
see both films if you can  	1
it was that yearhoweverthat reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella "the dead  	1
feelingsthoughtsgabriel's discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal  	1
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist  	0
it's very slow  	0
lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age  	0
 don't waste your time  	0
end of days is one of the worst big-budget action movies i've ever seen  	0
he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money  	0
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen  	0
i'm still trying to get over how bad it was  	0
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever  	1
it has everything you could want suspensedramacomedyconfusing subplotsnative americansbrain eating if you're looking for the be-allend-all of brainsucking movieslook no further  	1
" with great sound effectsand impressive special effectsi can't recommend this movie enough  	1
call me a nutbut i think this is one of the best movies ever  	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tediummelodrama and horrible actinga mess of a scriptand a sinking feeling of good lordwhat were they thinking?  	0
lots of holes in the script  	0
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
the dialogue is atrocious  	0
the acting is beyond abysmal  	0
everything stinks  	0
trouble isthe writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchablelike characterstorytheme and so on  	0
worsethere's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
it's dumb and pointlessand a complete waste of time  	0
in shortdon't bother with this movie  	0
i won't spoil itbut the ending in pretty amazing  	1
the best scene in the movie is at the endbut i won't spoil it  	1
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativitythen this is it  	1
the result is a powerhouse achievementmade more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrityand it's distorted interpretations of fame  	1
a film not easily forgotten  	1
butkevin spacey is an excellentverbal tsunami as buddy ackerman and totally believable because he is a great actor  	1
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years  	1
the characters are interestingeven if a bit predictable  	1
highly recommended for all agesalthough the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle referencesthey will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
great movie  	1
also the story and acting were weak  	0
at around 4 pm i bought itat around 8pm i started to watchat around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasn't  	0
either wayit sucks  	0
the script is horrendously stupid  	0
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest  	0
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid  	0
what the hell kind of crap is that?  	0
thenthere's the plot holes  	0
you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	0
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film  	1
she's poised and amazing  	1
dee snider just plain sucks  	0
he can't act one of the least scary villains i have ever seenhe can't write did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	0
the acting sucksthe music sucksthe script sucksthe pacing sucksthe special fx suckthe directing sucks basicallythis movie sucks  	0
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably  	0
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid  	0
avoid at any and all costs  	0
at any rate this film stinksits not funnyand fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
avoid this film at all costs  	0
i don't know what happened in season fivewhat a mess  	0
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	0
now this is a movie i really dislike  	0
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks  	0
the story is lamenot interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets  	0
there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible  	0
i felt asleep the first time i watched itso i can recommend it for insomniacs  	0
the fact isthis film is a wonderfulheartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams  	1
the best part about "nurse betty" is it's unpredictability  	1
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from realityand along with the touching dramaand hilarious comedyyou can never tell what is going to happen next  	1
otherwisedon't even waste your time on this  	0
this one just fails to create any real suspense  	0
as for the killerdon't expect anything original or even remotely frightening  	0
there ishoweversome pretty good acting at leastfor this type of film  	1
i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone  	0
one of the most boring,pointless movies i have ever seen  	0
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying  	0
hated it  	0
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad  	0
i don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie storeit's not even a real movie  	0
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash  	0
this is not movie-making  	0
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a bookthat's how bad it is  	0
so i am here to warn you--do not rent this movieit is the dumbest thing you have never seen  	0
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it  	1
i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes  	1
excellent short film  	1
hopefullythe director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same castor win us over with a whole new film  	1
i agree with jessicathis movie is pretty bad  	0
characters are one-dimensionaleven the good guys and especially the bad guys  	0
the story line is totally predictable  	0
not much dialoguenot much musicthe whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0

it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen  	1
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years  	1
the movie is not completely perfect but 'titta di girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie  	1
i rate this movie 9/10  	1
i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debutbut the pacingthe interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye  	1
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie  	1
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in "at play in the fields of the lord"  	1
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience  	1
it never condescendsall the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen  	1
they are so easy to lovebut even more easy to identify with  	1
this movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts  	1
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful  	1
the story is also both funny and poignant at times  	1
people who like european films and "art movies" will like this movie  	1
this is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it  	1
go rent it  	1
howeverafter finally watching this filmi realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depictsi also found myself watching it over and over again  	1
it's the one movie that never ceases to interest mesimply because it keeps me alertas i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings  	1
brilliance indeed  	1
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yettheir sequels i think you'll appreciate the thought provokingmindblowing experience this film will give you  	1
think of the film being like a dream  	1
simply beautiful  	1
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract  	1
it's a gloriously funfast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver  	1
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	1
just whatever you doavoid "groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic  	0
it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to qualityfor if they didwe'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess  	0
the movie seemed a little slow at first  	0
but it picked up speed and got right to the point  	1
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the "gadget"  	1
i enjoyed it  	1
i have recommended it to friends  	1
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz  	1
both actors truly understand and become their particular characterdelivering a convincingsincere performance  	1
their on-screen chemistrycritical to the entire filmis genuine  	1
the film's dialogue is naturalreal to life  	1
the writergorman bechardundoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate  	1
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film  	1
each track commands sentimentactually contributing to the scenes and characters  	1
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness  	1
hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili"gake no ue no ponyo" ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood  	1
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disney/pixar's cgi masterpiecesit is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories  	1
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film  	1
the art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful  	1
if you act in such a filmyou should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible  	0
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddonand this one fails everywhere  	0
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time  	0
stillit makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  	1
just consider the excellent storysolid acting and look of the film as added bonuses  	1
insteadwe got a bore fest about a whinyspoiled brat babysitting  	0

i keep watching it over and over  	1
it's a sad moviebut very good  	1
if you have not seen this moviei definitely recommend it  	1
she is as lovely as usualthis cutie  	1
still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow  	1
; recommend with confidence  	1
this movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself  	1
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander  	1
 anywaythe plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot  	1
the opening sequence of this gem is a classicand the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch  	1
fans of the genre will be in heaven  	1
lange had become a great actress  	1
it looked like a wonderful story  	1
i never walked out of a movie faster  	0
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off  	0
unfortunatelyany virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script  	0
in a wordit is embarrassing  	0
exceptionally bad  	0
all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money  	0
